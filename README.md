# Digital Photo Frame Project

## Made with <3 with a Raspberry Pi 3

[INSERT VIDEO/PICTURE HERE]

### Introduction

I have made a digital photo frame as a side project.
@See details [here](https://medium.com/@Gr3g0ire/un-cadre-photo-digital-19aee3bfddbc) (sorry in French for now) 
To simplify the control of the slideshow, I have written a quick app with React Native.

The server repo is ==> https://github.com/GWillmann/SlideshowUDPServer
The app repo is => https://github.com/GWillmann/SlideshowApp


This repo contains the react native code to run the app on either iOS or Android.

### Installation

- Be sure to install and run the server first.
- Open the project in either Android Studio or XCode and run on your device

### Thanks
This side project was greatly inspired by 

- https://github.com/tradle/react-native-udp 
- https://pymotw.com/2/socket/udp.html


Without thoses resources, it would probably have never seen the bright
lights of Github repos!
